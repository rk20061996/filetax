                            <p>The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)is an development in US. efforts to combat tax evasion by
                                US. persons holding accounts and other financial assets offshore.This FATCA requirement is in addition
                                to the long-standing requirement to report foreign financial accounts on FinCEN Form 114. FATCA will
                                also require certain foreign financial institutions to report directly to the IRS information about
                                financial accounts held by US. taxpayers or by foreign entities in which US. taxpayers hold a
                                substantial ownership interest. The reporting institutions will include not only banks, but also
                                other financial institutions, such as investment entities, brokers, and certain insurance companies.</p>
                            <p>FATCA provides special reporting requirements about the US. account holders of certain financial
                                institutions that do not solicit business outside their country of organization and that mainly
                                service account holders resident within it.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div className="col-sm-12 col-md-5">

                            <p>Therefore, if you set up a new account with a foreign financial institution, it may ask you for
                                information about your citizenship. FATCA provides special (and lessened) reporting requirements about
                                the US. account holders of certain financial institutions that do not solicit business outside their
                                country of organization and that mainly service account holders resident within it. In order to
                                qualify for this favorable treatment, however, the local foreign financial institution cannot
                                discriminate by declining to open or maintain accounts for US. citizens who reside in the country
                                where- it is organized.</p>
                            <p>FATCA requires certain US. taxpayers who hold foreign financial assets with an aggregate value of
                                more than the reporting threshold (at least $50,000) to report information about those assets on
                                Form 8938, which must be attached to the taxpayerâ€™s annual income tax return. The reporting
                                threshold is higher for certain individuals, including married taxpayers filing a joint annual
                                income tax return and certain taxpayers living in a foreign country.</p>
                            <p>As of January 2013, only individuals are required to report their foreign financial assets.
                                At a later time, a limited set of US. domestic entities also may have to report their foreign
                                financial assets, but not for tax years starting before 2013. There are some exceptions to the
                                requirement that you file Form 8938. For example, if you do not have to file a US. income tax
                                return for the year, then you do not have to file Form 8938, regardless of the value of your
                                specified foreign financial assets. Also, if you report interests in foreign entities and
                                certain foreign gifts on other forms, you may just list the submitted forms on Form 8938,
                                without repeating the details.</p>
